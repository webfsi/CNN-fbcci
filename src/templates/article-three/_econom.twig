					<h2>Growing and Learning with Technology</h2>
					<p>Beyond financial services, Bangladesh is promoting digital ecosystems in other sectors. In particular, the adoption of technology in agriculture has been recognized as key to achieving food security, boosting productivity, and stimulating economic growth—all of which contribute to Bangladesh’s vision of becoming a developed nation by 2041. Among its many initiatives in this sector, the government has been working with the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization on the Digital Villages program to provide digital services and support to farmers across the nation. It has also rolled out various online resources, including apps and websites, to empower those working in the agriculture sector.</p>
					<p>Farmers are not the only ones reaping the benefits of digitalization. The transformation of Bangladesh’s agriculture sector has also presented plenty of opportunities for investments, especially with the country being fertile ground for agritech startups such as iFarmer—a digital platform which creates access to financing, advisory services, and distribution channels for farmers—which raised over $2 million in investments in 2022.</p>

					<p>Another key focus in Bangladesh’s drive for digital transformation is education. Initiatives in this field have been especially notable for being collaborative, multidimensional, and focused on human-centric learning experiences. Ample efforts have also been made to address the digital divide in education to make sure no student is left behind.</p>
					<p>“One of the key focuses of our corporate sustainability efforts is working towards empowering women with future skills development for employability,” says Rahman. As such, HSBC has been working with the British Council on the EDGE: English and Digital for Girls’ Education program to provide 21st-century skills to marginalized or out-of-school adolescents in Bangladesh so they can achieve brighter futures. The bank also recently joined forces with the Asian University for Women to launch the HSBC-AUW School of Apparel and Retail Management master’s program, which aims to equip women with the skills and resources to become tech-savvy and sustainably-minded leaders in Bangladesh’s fast-evolving textiles and garments industry.</p>
